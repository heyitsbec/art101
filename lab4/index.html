	<h1>Lab 4: Psuedocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p> For this lab we had to pseudocode an everyday task that most students may not be familar with and also a computer task. We chose to write about checking the oil in a car and a minesweeper game. Then we had to turn these steps into Javascirpt comments and add them into our index.file. Finally we had to create this page!</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p> We didn't run into any problems other than being confused about some of the wording on the prompt.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Below is our JavaScript code that we wrote for our everyday and computer tasks.</p>

		// A short guide on how to check the oil in a car and how to make a minesweeper game.
		// Both guides are step by step.

		//How to check the oil in your car:
		  //Park the vehicle on level ground
		  //Get a paper towel or rag
		  //Open the hood of your car
		    //Pull the hood release lever that is inside the car
		    //Go to the front of the hood
		    //Find the secondary release.
		    //Lift the hood
		    //Use prop prod to hold it
		  //Find the dipstick tube (it usually has an oil logo on or near it)
		  //Grab the handle of the dipstick and pull it completely out
		  //Wipe the oil off the stick using your towel
		  //Now that the stick is clean put it back in the tube and swiftly pull it back out
		    //Make sure to hold the dipstick level so that the oil doesn’t drip down
		  //Now check where the oil level is on the stick
		    //Depending on what kind of car you have, the markings will be different on the end of the stick
		    //Refer to your owner’s manual to read how high or low your oil is and how much oil you might need


		//How to make a minesweeper game

		//Set the number of mines, columns, and rows
		//Loop through all columns to create grids (randomly distribute mines)
		  //Loop through all rows to create grids
		//While the winning or losing condition is not fulfilled
		  //Player flip or put a flag on a unflipped grid
		  //Show the result of the input
		  //Check if the new input fulfills winning or losing condition
		    //If input fulfills any condition, the game ends
		    //Else, loop back to accept player input
