//How to check the oil in your car:
  //Park the vehicle on level ground
  //Get a paper towel or rag
  //Open the hood of your car
    //Pull the hood release lever that is inside the car
    //Go to the front of the hood
    //Find the secondary release.
    //Lift the hood
    //Use prop prod to hold it
  //Find the dipstick tube (it usually has an oil logo on or near it)
  //Grab the handle of the dipstick and pull it completely out
  //Wipe the oil off the stick using your towel
  //Now that the stick is clean put it back in the tube and swiftly pull it back out
    //Make sure to hold the dipstick level so that the oil doesn’t drip down
  //Now check where the oil level is on the stick
    //Depending on what kind of car you have, the markings will be different on the end of the stick
    //Refer to your owner’s manual to read how high or low your oil is and how much oil you might need
