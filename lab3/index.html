	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>For this lab, we had to check our local file structure and format our webpage so that all of our labs would be on the website. To do this we had to add index.html files and pay attention to new coding tags and technique we learned in lectures thus far.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I struggled with minor mistakes in my code like forgetting a / or mispelling a file name which caused the website not to work. Once I went back and proof read my code these mistakes were easy to fix. It was just a little bit tedious.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is the file structure I created which allows you to be seeing this page!</p>

	<h3>Screenshots for Lab 3</h2>
	<p>These are the screenshots I took for Lab 3!</p>

	<p>Here you can see the initial structure when we started the lab.</p>
	<img id="updated-home" src="img/updatedhomepage.png" />
	<p>This screenshot shows our new home page as we view it in browser for the first time.</p>
	<img id="code-home" src="img/codeforhome.png" />
	<p>This is the code I wrote to make the home page which you can preview in the screenshot above.</p>
	<img id="code-labthree" src="img/codeforlabthree.png" />
	<p>This is the code behind the page you are seeing now--without the screenshots.</p>

	<p>This is the old Lab 3 page before adding these screenshots. It is fun to look at the code in the previous step and see how it made this image.</p>
