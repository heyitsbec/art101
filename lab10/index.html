	<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

	<hr>

	<div class = "sections">

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab we had to experiment with JS events.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I had a few typos as usual with my code that presented me with different errors. Once I fixed the puncuation and spelling of a few things I was able to complete the lab.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>My partner and I also completed bonus task questions 1 and 2. We were able to use similar code from Lab 7 to make an anagram. For question 2 we added another input field which returned the results to our output div. Here are our results: </p>

		<div id = "outputBlock">
			<h2>Script Output</h2>

			<lable for = "inputField">Input your name:
				<input type = "text" id = "user-name">
				<button id = "inputButton">Get your name</button>
			</label>

		<br><br>

		<lable for = "inputField">Add something to the output div:<br>
			<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
			<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
			<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
			<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
			<button id="extraButton">Let's add it</button>
		</label>

			<div id = "output"></div>
		</div>
