		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>For this lab we had to explore basic JavaScript data types and variables with our partner.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had problems with changing the size of the photo in CSS. I had ordered the img id="picture" incorrectly; I had the src before the id. So I fixed that and added some code in CSS to make the photo 500 px and align to the right of the page.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>After updating a photo of Stacy, my Chevy Cruz, and fixing my code, I sucessfully created the page you are looking at.</p>
		<h3>Script Output</h3>
		<div class=output>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>
